# klabber
This is a twitter-like scheduling website made just for fun.
----
This uses Django, React.js (I'm also using material-ui to make the website look nicer) and REST API.


I focused more on functionality (backend) over looks (frontend) as backend interests me more than designing.

# How to use this website

You can make a new account or log in using an existing account.

Once you've signed in, you have can post a status update and see other users status updates too.

To add friends, head over to the "Friends" tab on the left and you can see all your friends, other users as well as friend requests.

On the home page, head over to "Create klab" to create a new event. If you don't want to create a new event, you can join klabs hosted by other users instead via the "Find klab" page. To join klabs, you'll have to send a request to the host and the host will either accept your request or decline your request.
